<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Background

The modern world feels like a very small place with six degrees of separation and social networking apps increasing visibility to everyone on its platform around the world. Yet why is it the case when we explore a new city for the first time, it is as if we are completely alone and left to make new connections by ourselves? Is there a better solution? iPair seeks to help individuals meet new people and engage in their activities together. 

> Goal: Get users off the app as quick as possible. ðŸ¤”

The point is not to squeeze as much capital out of each user and profit from obtrusive advertisements. Everything about the application is developed to be as intuitive, quick, and seamless as to not detract from your activities.
